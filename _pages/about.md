Welcome! I am currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science at Peking University.

My academic work has been [published](publications) or is in submission to conferences/journals. My first work in Peking Univeristy is about pre-training Masked Autoencoders(MAE) with point clouds and images. We designed several interesting yet effective mechenism to improve modal interactives and thus improved model performance on downstream tasked. 

I have also worked as a intern in a startup company called [BodyPark](http://www.bodypark.cn/home) that offers online private training classes. In each lesson, AI model would perform 2D human pose estimation and give suggestions like 'raise your arm higher' to users, and the human private trainer would give more detailed instructions to meet the users' actual needs. I was attracted by such idea when I first heard it and soon became an intern in the AI department. During that period, I experienced working at AI industry and developed practical engineering ablities like git branch mangament, time-management, problem-sovling abilities. etc.
