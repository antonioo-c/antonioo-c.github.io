Welcome! I am currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science at Peking University.

My academic work has been published or is in press to conferences/journals. Detailed information is in [here](publications).

My first work at Peking Univeristy is about pre-training Masked Autoencoders(MAE) with point clouds and images. I worked with Prof. Shanghang Zhang for 8 months and we designed several interesting yet effective mechenisms to improve modal interaction and thus improved model performance on downstream tasks. Our work <i>PiMAE: Point Cloud and Image Interactive Masked Autoencoders for 3D Object Detection</i> is in press to CVPR2023.

I have also worked as an intern in a startup company called [BodyPark](http://www.bodypark.cn/home) that offers online private training classes. During that period, I mainly focused on improving model performance to solve human pose estimation problems specailly when users are facing back to the camera or when users are moving quickly that the image is in blur. I incorporated innovative techniques into the model and succesfully improved its generalization ablity. See [My Experiences](experiences) for more details.
